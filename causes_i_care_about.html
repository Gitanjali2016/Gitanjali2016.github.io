  <h1>Causes I Care About</h1>
  <p>When I was a sixth grader, I participated in a mass awareness campaign against Cancer and AIDS which lasted for 10 days. <br>
    I was actively involved in fund-raising and was awarded a Certificate of Recognition for Outstanding Social Service.<br>

I care about Women Empowerment, with an emphasis on Women in Science and Technology. Recently, an article I wrote, titled, "An Opinion Does Not Have a Gender",<br>
 has been accepted in my School's annual magazine. It emphasizes on the importance of women being able to voice their opinions with confidence and dignity.<br>
I did one year of school (7th grade) in Colfax K-8, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. There, I was selected to attend a program for encouraging school girls to pursue <br>
Computer Science, organized by Carnegie Mellon University (see here). It was a very encouraging event and my interest in computer science and technology<br>
got enhanced by attending this event.</p>


<p>I also care a lot about justice towards animals. Every living creature deserves to be treated with respect and it is the duty of us human beings<br>
   to guarantee that respect to them. Having grown up mostly in India, it hurts me to see so many stray animals like dogs and cows, weak and sickly, <br>
   with no one to care for them. I dream that one day I will be able to open a shelter for homeless animals where they will be cared for and loved.</p>
